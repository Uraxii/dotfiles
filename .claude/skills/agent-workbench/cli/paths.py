"""Repo-root and sibling-artifact path resolution for the CLI.

The skill lives at ``<repo>/.claude/skills/agent-workbench/``. Every
ported subcommand needs to locate artifacts elsewhere in the repo: the
`kb` port delegates to ``<repo>/scripts/kb-serve.py`` (and its hyphenated
siblings), and `deploy` builds from the two Containerfiles under
``<repo>/scripts/kb-container/`` and
``<repo>/.claude/skills/artifact-serve/container/``. Centralizing that
math here keeps it out of the individual subcommand modules.
